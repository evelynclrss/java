_Problem Set: Intro to iteration and conditional logics_

As a beginner programmer, it's important to practice computational thinking in order to improve your problem-solving skills. 
One way to do this is by working through programming problems that challenge you to think creatively and logically. 
In this problem set, we'll explore types of problems that will help you practice your computational thinking skills: *stars and ladder*

Sets:

1. Box Stars <br>

Write a Java program that takes an integer n as input and prints n rows of stars. Each row should have n stars takes from variable called ```userNum```.
For example, if ```userNum = 4```, the program should output:
```
****
****
****
****
```

2. Basic Ladder <br>

Write a Java program that takes an integer n as input and prints a ladder of stars with n steps. Value of n takes from variable called ```ladderHeight```.
Each step should have one more star than the previous step. For example, if n = 4, the program should output:
```
*
**
***
****
```

3. Diamond stars <br>

Write a Java program that takes an odd integer n as input and prints a diamond shape made of stars. Value of n takes from variable called ```diamondKarat```
The diamond should have n rows and n columns in total. For example, if n = 5, the program should output:
```
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
```
