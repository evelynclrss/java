*Problem Set: Introduction to Github*

This problem set is designed to help new programmers understand the basics of using Github, a popular platform for version control and collaboration in software development. By learning about Github, you will gain a valuable skill that is widely used in the software industry and will be able to collaborate on projects more efficiently with others.

Goal:
1. Understanding Repositories: Explain what a Github repository is and how to create one.
2. Commit Changes: Demonstrate how to make changes to a file in a repository and how to commit those changes.
3. Collaboration: Show how to collaborate with others on a Github project by creating a branch, making changes, and creating a pull request.
4. Issues and Pull Requests: Explain the difference between issues and pull requests and demonstrate how to use each in a Github repository.

Sets:
1. Understanding Repositories:
Create a new Github account
Create a new repository called "My First Repository"
Add a file called "README.md" to the repository and include a brief description of what the repository is for

2. Commit Changes:
Open the "README.md" file in the "My First Repository"
Make some changes to the file, such as adding a heading or changing the text
Commit the changes with a descriptive commit message

3. Collaboration:
Invite a friend to collaborate on the "My First Repository"
Have your friend create a new branch called "feature-x"
Have your friend make some changes to the "README.md" file on the "feature-x" branch
Have your friend create a pull request to merge the "feature-x" branch into the main branch
Review the changes in the pull request and merge the branch if everything looks good

4. Issues and Pull Requests:
Create a new issue in the "My First Repository"
Label the issue as a "bug"
Have your friend comment on the issue with a suggestion for a fix
Create a new branch based on the suggestion
Make the changes to the "README.md" file to fix the bug
Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the main branch
Review the changes in the pull request and merge the branch if everything looks good
