_Problem Set: Intro to conditional and looping_

Welcome to this problem set designed to help you practice your looping and conditional skills in programming. These exercises are designed to be deliberately challenging, and they will help you improve your problem-solving abilities as well as your ability to write clear and efficient pseudocode.

It is important to remember that the key to mastering these skills is to practice regularly and deliberately. Take the time to study each problem carefully, and try to come up with multiple solutions. Don't worry if your first attempt doesn't work - that's all part of the learning process.

Before you begin, it may be helpful to review the basic concepts of loops and conditionals in programming. Make sure you understand how to write a for loop, a while loop, and an if/else statement.

The problems in this set start off easier and gradually increase in difficulty, so don't be discouraged if you find some of them more challenging than others. The key is to keep practicing and building your skills, one step at a time. Good luck!

Sets:

1. Write a program that prints out the numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Write a program that prints out the even numbers from 1 to 20.
3. Write a program that takes an input number from the user, and prints out whether the number is odd or even.
4. Write a program that takes an input number from the user, and prints out the multiplication table for that number up to 10.
5. Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and then asks the user to guess the number. The program should tell the user whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct, and then allow the user to guess again until they guess the correct number.
