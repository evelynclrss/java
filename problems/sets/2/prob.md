Here is a problem set to help you understand conditional statements, loops, and variables in Java:

1. Conditional Statements:
Learn how to use if-else and switch statements to make decisions in your code.

Problem: Write a program that takes a number as input and prints "Positive" if the number is positive, "Negative" if the number is negative, and "Zero" if the number is zero.

2. Loops:
Learn how to use for, while, and do-while loops to repeat sections of code.

Problem: Write a program that prints the first 10 natural numbers.

3. Variables:
Learn how to declare, initialize, and use variables in Java.

Problem: Write a program that takes two numbers as input and swaps their values.

4. Arrays:
Learn how to use arrays to store multiple values of the same data type.

Problem: Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and finds the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Final Project:

Put your skills to the test by creating a final project that showcases what you have learned in this problem set.

Problem: Write a program that implements a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The program should use methods and conditional statements to determine the operation to perform and display the result to the user.
This problem set will help you understand the basics of programming in Java and how to use conditional statements, loops, variables, arrays, and methods. Good luck!
