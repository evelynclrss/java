*Problem Set: Introduction to Github*

This problem set is designed to help new programmers understand the basics of using Github, a popular platform for version control and collaboration in software development. By learning about Github, you will gain a valuable skill that is widely used in the software industry and will be able to collaborate on projects more efficiently with others.

Goal:
1. Understanding Repositories: Explain what a Github repository is and how to create one.
2. Commit Changes: Demonstrate how to make changes to a file in a repository and how to commit those changes.
3. Collaboration: Show how to collaborate with others on a Github project by creating a branch, making changes, and creating a pull request.
4. Issues and Pull Requests: Explain the difference between issues and pull requests and demonstrate how to use each in a Github repository.

Sets:
1. Understanding Repositories:
Create a new Github account
Create a new repository called "My First Repository"
Add a file called "README.md" to the repository and include a brief description of what the repository is for

2. Commit Changes:
Open the "README.md" file in the "My First Repository"
Make some changes to the file, such as adding a heading or changing the text
Commit the changes with a descriptive commit message

3. Collaboration:
Invite a friend to collaborate on the "My First Repository"
Have your friend create a new branch called "feature-x"
Have your friend make some changes to the "README.md" file on the "feature-x" branch
Have your friend create a pull request to merge the "feature-x" branch into the main branch
Review the changes in the pull request and merge the branch if everything looks good

4. Issues and Pull Requests:
Create a new issue in the "My First Repository"
Label the issue as a "bug"
Have your friend comment on the issue with a suggestion for a fix
Create a new branch based on the suggestion
Make the changes to the "README.md" file to fix the bug
Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the main branch
Review the changes in the pull request and merge the branch if everything looks good

*Problem Set: Create your first project repository*

Final Project: Personal Portfolio Website

For this final project, you will put into practice everything you have learned about Github in this problem set. You will create a personal portfolio website to showcase your projects and skills. Dont worry, HTML file will be provided in this file.

1. Repository Setup:
Create a new Github account if you don't already have one
Create a new repository called "My Portfolio"
Initialize the repository with a README file

2. Commit Changes:
Create a new file called "index.html" in the "My Portfolio" repository
Use HTML to create a basic structure for the website, including a header, main content area, and footer
Add some dummy content to the website, such as your name and a description of your skills and interests
Commit the changes with a descriptive commit message

3. Collaboration:
Create a new branch called "feature-x"
Make some changes to the "index.html" file on the "feature-x" branch, such as adding a new section for your projects
Create a pull request to merge the "feature-x" branch into the main branch
Review the changes in the pull request and merge the branch if everything looks good
Issues and Pull Requests:
Create an issue to track a bug in the "My Portfolio" repository
Label the issue as a "bug"
Create a new branch based on the issue to fix the bug
Make the changes to the "index.html" file to fix the bug
Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the main branch
Review the changes in the pull request and merge the branch if everything looks good

4. Final Deliverables:
A completed personal portfolio website hosted on Github Pages
A README file with a description of the project and how to run the website locally
A showcase of the website and the Github repository to demonstrate your work.

By completing this final project, you will have a hands-on experience of using Github to create and manage a personal portfolio website. You will have the opportunity to use key Github features, such as repositories, commits, branches, pull requests, and issues, to develop and maintain your website. Good luck!
