# Problem
#### By Fandika Ikhsan

Here is a problem set for beginners who are learning to program using the 
Scratch app from MIT:

1. Introduction to Scratch:
Learn the basic interface of Scratch by how to create a sprite and a 
background. Learn the capability of scratch.
Problem: Create a simple animation of a sprite moving across the screen.

2. Learn conditional based on user inputs:
Lets make a sprite move and change direction.
Problem: Create scratch where the sprite avoids obstacles and reaches a 
target. For example you can make a snake-like game with always moving snake and use
arrow keyboard to change snake's direction to eat an apple.

3. Learn variable and events:
Lets enhance your game by set some variable to store your value. Value updated based on
some events, for example if snake eat an apple, then there is variable called ```points``` and updated by 1.
Or if your snake hit the wall then there is a variable called ```lives``` and updated by 1.

Project:

Put your skills to the test by creating a final project that showcases 
what you have learned in this problem set.
Problem: Create a complete game or animation with several levels (level and animation are optional), with scoring and game over screens.
This problem set will help you learn the basics of programming and game 
development using the Scratch app, and will give you a solid foundation to 
build upon as you continue your journey in programming.

Your project will be presented in next meet.
