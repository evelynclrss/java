Here is a problem set for beginners who are learning to program using the 
Scratch app from MIT:

Introduction to Scratch:

Learn the basic interface of Scratch and how to create a sprite and a 
background.
Problem: Create a simple animation of a sprite moving across the screen.
Basic Movements:

Learn how to make a sprite move and change direction.
Problem: Create a game where the sprite avoids obstacles and reaches a 
target.
User Interactions:

Learn how to make a sprite respond to user input.
Problem: Create a game where the sprite collects items and the user 
controls its movements using the arrow keys.
Animation and Design:

Learn how to create simple animations and enhance the visual design of 
your game.
Problem: Create a simple platformer game with moving platforms and a 
sprite that jumps and collects coins.
Sound and Music:

Learn how to add sound and music to your game.
Problem: Create a rhythm game where the sprite moves in time with the 
music and collects notes in rhythm.
Advanced Techniques:

using variables and conditional statements.
Problem: Create a game where the sprite avoids enemies and collects 
power-ups, and the difficulty level increases as the game progresses.
Final Project:

Put your skills to the test by creating a final project that showcases 
what you have learned in this problem set.
Problem: Create a complete game or animation with several levels, sound 
and music, and advanced features such as scoring and game over screens.
This problem set will help you learn the basics of programming and game 
development using the Scratch app, and will give you a solid foundation to 
build upon as you continue your journey in programming.
