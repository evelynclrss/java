# Learn Java with Fandika

---
### Intro

In this repo we'll discuss about java as a tools for explaining computational thinking. I think we should start by how to form think procedural like computer does. Today, computer "seems" like most powerful tools that human have. But, its opposite, computer is the most dumbest thing ever we should teach them to do something for us. by speak like they do.

So, in this repo we will summarize how to speak with computer to do what we ask for. Start from learn how they think.

### General Rules

We will try to make this repo as a discussion forum. This repo would accomondate us the question about the lecturer, about updating the missing piece on the docs, provide the question and the answers. 

First thing first, if you have any question then start the discussion by opening issue. 

Also I will update the material and exercise problems and any answer should be written on a single branch with branch name:

```problem/{problem_num}-{your_name}```

So for instance if I want to answer problem no 5, then I will create a branch called:

```problem/5-fandikaikhsan```

Then you should open pull request to branch called ```problem/answers``` and peers will comment to your PR to discuss about the topics or to assess your answer.

And I also realy encourage you to also refine our documents here by writing your understanding in with your own terms. If you have any input or your own version revision, just open the issue and tag-it with ```docs```.

### Resources

I provide several reverences for your futher reading. Our main referances comes from University of Massachusetts Amherst: https://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/Teaching/121_S12/syllabus.html then I also refer to Harvard courses to provide algorithm concepts here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/3/, another references comes from this article: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-basic-syntax/

If you have any good references, please open an issue and also set as ```docs``` tags. If there is any slides uses in the sync activities will be provided here in the future.

# TLDR

### Intro

Java is a high-level programming language that is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is object-oriented, meaning it allows programmers to define objects and classes that can be used to represent real-world entities and their properties and behaviors.

One of the main benefits of Java is that it can run on a wide variety of platforms, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. This is made possible by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which interprets compiled Java code and executes it on the underlying hardware. The JVM also provides security features that prevent malicious code from compromising the system.

Another key tool for Java developers is the Java Development Kit (JDK), which includes the JVM and a set of tools for compiling and debugging Java code. The most popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java is Eclipse, which provides a comprehensive set of tools for coding, testing, and deploying Java applications.

To get started with Java, you need to first install the JDK on your computer. The installation process is straightforward, and there are versions available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Here are the steps to install the JDK on a Windows machine:

Download the latest JDK from the official Oracle website (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
Run the downloaded setup file.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.
Verify that the JDK has been installed correctly by opening a command prompt and typing "java -version". You should see the version of Java that you have installed.
Once you have installed the JDK, you are ready to start coding in Java! You can use an IDE like Eclipse, or a simple text editor, to write your code. Java code is saved with a ".java" file extension, and must be compiled into bytecode before it can be executed by the JVM.

In conclusion, Java is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used for developing applications. With the JVM, JDK, and Eclipse, you have all the tools you need to start coding in Java and building your own applications.
